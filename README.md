# UVic Courses to Calendar

Convert your courses to calendar events with the click of a button!
This extension allows you to generate a ".ics" file that you can then manually import into Google Calendar or similar, to allow you to remember your classes on the go.

Future work: 
Add OAuth to allow direct addition to the user's Google calendar instead of the manual import step.
